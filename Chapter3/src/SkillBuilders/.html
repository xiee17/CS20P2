Beyond his vocal talent, his compositions are beautifully crafted, and his unique style keeps me coming back for more. Every time I listen to his music, I find something new to connect with, which is why he remains my top choice whenever I need a soundtrack for my day. I've also been to his concert once, it was impressive and completely shows his humourous
